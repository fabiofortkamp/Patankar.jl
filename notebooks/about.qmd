Hi there. I'm FÃ¡bio Fortkamp, a researcher and engineer from southern Brazil.

My current work is focused on the development of software packages dedicated
to the oil & gas industry, so I'm very interested in the use of data science
focused languages (Python, Julia & R) in Thermal Engineering problems (like
the heat transfer and fluid flow phenomena in wellbores).

In February 2024, I also started to co-supervise a PhD thesis on the transient
modeling of petroleum flow, so I decided to study along my new student the
fundamentals of Computational Fluid Flow. Although I have studied and used
this subject extensively in my career, even having taught some classes on it,
I thought it was the time for a refresh.

So Patanjar.jl is a project where I go through my favorite CFD book by S. V. 
Patankar [^1] (on this website termed "the Patankar book") and type out
my notes and solutions to the exercises. I decided to use Julia for 
implementing the computational part, as it is my favorite language
for prototyping and reasoning about mathematics and computational.

All the sources (for the website and the code) in on the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/fabiofortkamp/Patankar.jl). Feel free
to [file an issue](https://github.com/fabiofortkamp/Patankar.jl/issues) if you 
have any comment.
